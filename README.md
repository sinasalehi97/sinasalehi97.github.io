Bio

Sina Salehipour is studying at San Diego State University in the field of Transportation Engineering. The Sharif University of Technology awarded him a civil engineering bachelor's degree in 2020. He is presently employed with San Diego State University's Smart Transportation Analytics Research lab as a graduate research assistant. Within the field of big data, Sina's study focuses mainly on improving the safety of road users in an intersection in Chula Vista, San Diego. This research aims to study user interactions and proactively assess safety at this intersection by identifying near-crash events.



**I'm interested in introducing a Data Set in blow from the awesome-data science GitHub:**

[NYC Taxis: A Day in the Life](http://chriswhong.github.io/nyctaxi/) is the name of the data collection I selected. I chose this data set because it is about taxis, one of the components of the Transportation system related to my major, Transportation Engineering.

In this data set and site, a visualization of a random taxi on a single day in New York City has been created to find out how much a taxi driver makes in a day and how busy a taxi is throughout 24 hours. As all we know, transportation plays a vital role in our daily life and public transportation like taxis is one of them. As a result, this topic is very crucial to my major since, in a large city like New York, many people depend on taxis for going from one place to another location, and the drivers' salaries should be sufficient to meet their needs to have fluent public transportation in the city. 

This data set creator utilizes Heroku as a cloud platform and deployed API to develop the database system. In their project, they took very valuable advantage of sharing their code on GitHub to develop the project. Overall, data science is growing in scope, and by using services like GitHub, a public space for programmers, we can share our expertise and assist one another in resolving and improving our projects.


**Intoducing ONE selected "free-data-science-book":**

I chose an online course titled “Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification,” which is learned by Andrew Ng, the founder of Coursera.

I chose this course because in the previous semester(spring 2022), I took the machine learning course, and I became interested in this area. Moreover,  my research project is related to machine learning, and I need to be an expert in this area. In this course, the instructor tries to learn about the bases of machine learning by using Python in 41 videos, totaling 33 hours of videos. So, I think it would be a good opportunity for every student who wants to learn machine learning with Python from the base. This course is perfect because it thoroughly introduces contemporary machine learning, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression, neural networks, logistic regression), unsupervised learning (convolutional neural networks), and many other topics such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, etc.

Data scientists can benefit significantly from expertise in machine learning. Everywhere we have a set of data, such as in the fields of transportation, medical, traffic, and the military, is a potential machine learning consumer.
